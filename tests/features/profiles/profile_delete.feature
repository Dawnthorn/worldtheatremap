Feature: Delete profiles

  As a user
  I want to be able to delete profiles
  So information remains accurate

  Background:
    Given I am on the English language home page

  # Scenario: Users should be able to delete a profile
  #   And I am logged in
  #   And I go to the "profile" add page
  #   And I fill in ".profile-name-edit" with "Fatima"
  #   And I click on ".edit-profile-save"
  #   When I click on ".page-delete-link"
  #   And I accept the alert
  #   Then there should be no profile with the name "Fatima"

  # Logged out not allowed
